intro: |
  Hi, thanks for swinging by!

  I'm Nicolas Castrillon, but you can call me Nico. My background is a bit like a composite material: the matrix is hands-on mechanical design, and the reinforcing fibers are computational methods for engineering analysis. This composition has come in handy for my quest to advance technologies for advanced manufacturing processes.

  I am intrigued by design methodologies and pasionate about innovation.

  These drivers are a constant in my work. In industry I designed mechanical systems for washer and dryer machines at GE Appliances in Louisville, KY and gas turbine power plants for GE Power in Houston, TX. I am also a co-inventor for a [design patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130232810A1/en). Having designed parts and assemblies in these vastly-different industries gave me a wide survey of both traditional fabrication methods and advanced additive manufacturing methods, such as selective laser sintering and fused deposition modeling. At GE, I fully owned all sub-assembly requirement metrics, including safety, quality, reliability, manufacturability, and fit+feel+finish.

  Continuing on my path of innovation, I put my 8-year career on pause and was fortunate to move to Berkeley, CA to start a Ph.D. program in computational manufacturing and product design methods in affiliation with the [Multiphysics Simulation and Optimization Lab](https://msol.berkeley.edu/). I see scientific coding as a crucial tool for success in any engineering field. I have chosen to apply myself to simulating additive manufacturing processes, quantifying their inherent sources of uncertianty and understanding their sensitivities to process inputs. All within the spirit of innovating tangible processes.

  After my expected graduation in 2022 I hope to re-energize my career via my enhanced hands-on mechanical design experience, my simulation skills, and my product design methodologies.

  I love working in teams with diversity, equiality, and inclusion. Both at GE and at UC Berkeley, I have always been an active leader within minority groups. I was a Develop & Inspire Leader at the GE Hispanic Forum in Houston and I am currently the Corporate Liaison for [LAGSES](https://lagses.berkeley.edu/) on campus, roles where I have brought to life events with company recruiters and executives to further the careers of minority members in these organizations.

  Additionally, I am constantly self-educating about my racial biases and redefining my personal intersectionality. I lead a [book club](https://gwe.berkeley.edu/media-club/) within the UC Berkeley campus spanning LAGSES and the Graduate Women in Engineering (GWE) where students of all walks of life come together to discuss various books and media to spur safe and uncomfortable conversations.

  In my spare time, I am an avid soccer player, a social rock climber, and an adventurous hiker-dad. My wife and I absolutely love watching our baby daughter get a kick out of leaves rustling in the wind.
